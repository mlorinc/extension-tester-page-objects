# extension-tester-page-objects

This repository contains page object common API
for [Monaco](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/) based editors.
The common API was created to achieve compatibility between testers
so it is possible to share created tests.

At this moment the page object API is suited for Visual Studio Code and Eclipse Theia editors.

## New features

When proposing new features please bear in mind it must be useable in all supported testers. Currently theia-extension-tester and vscode-extension-tester are supported testers.
